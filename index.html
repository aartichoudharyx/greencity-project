    <p class="text-small">"Green City Patna" is a term used to describe the city of Patna, located in the northern Indian state of Bihar, which has been undergoing various initiatives to improve its environmental sustainability and green cover.
        In recent years, the government of Bihar and various civic bodies have taken steps towards transforming Patna into a more eco-friendly city. These initiatives include the development of green spaces such as parks and gardens, the promotion of cycling and public transportation, and the implementation of waste management systems to reduce pollution.
One of the key projects undertaken to make Patna a green city is the "Patna Green Project," which aims to increase the city's green cover from 5% to 15% by planting around 2 million trees. The project also includes plans for rainwater harvesting, renewable energy sources, and waste management.
Other initiatives to improve the city's sustainability include the introduction of electric buses and rickshaws, the installation of solar-powered streetlights, and the promotion of eco-friendly practices such as composting and recycling.
While there is still a long way to go in making Patna a fully green city, these efforts show that the government and citizens are committed to improving the city's environment and creating a more sustainable future.</p
